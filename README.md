# Computational Unit Hardware Project

This repository contains the design and implementation of a hardware component comprising three computational units, each built from a 2x1 multiplexer. The project includes Verilog source code, testbenches, schematics, simulation waveforms, and a detailed report.

## Project Overview

- **Component:** 3 Computational Units (each a 2x1 mux)
- **Operations Supported:** AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Comparisons (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
- **Verification:** Manual calculations and simulation waveforms

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: Verilog source code for the computational units and top-level module
- `testbench/`: Testbench files for simulation and verification
- `docs/`: Project documentation, including the report and block diagrams
- `results/`: Simulation waveforms and schematic images

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the source code in your HDL tool (Vivado, ModelSim, etc.).
3. Run the testbenches to verify functionality.
4. Review the documentation in the `docs/` folder for design details and results.
