# Computational Unit Hardware Project

This repository contains the design and implementation of a hardware component comprising three computational units, each built from a 2x1 multiplexer. The project includes Verilog source code, testbenches, schematics, simulation waveforms, and a detailed report.

## Project Overview

- **Component:** 3 Computational Units (each a 2x1 mux)
- **Operations Supported:** AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Comparisons (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
- **Verification:** Manual calculations and simulation waveforms


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the source code in your HDL tool (Vivado, ModelSim, etc.).
3. Run the testbenches to verify functionality.
