# Computational-Unit-Hardware-Project
A digital hardware project in Verilog implementing three computational units, each built from a 2x1 multiplexer. The system supports 15 operations including logic, arithmetic, and comparison functions. Includes code, testbenches, block diagrams, simulation waveforms, and a detailed report for verification and learning in structural digital design.
